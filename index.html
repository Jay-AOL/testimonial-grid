          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
          were current, if not more so,in the company I joined. I
          honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

          "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
          I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some
          people who had amazing experience here. I signed up for
          the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
          shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most
          grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I'v
          successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer
          at a VR startup."

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp

          "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.
          I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of their's who can only say wonderful things about the
          program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
          They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
          The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
          learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could never
          have. Infact, I've often referred to it during interview's as an
          example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a
          job as a full-stack developer after recieving multiple offers. 100%
          recommended! "
